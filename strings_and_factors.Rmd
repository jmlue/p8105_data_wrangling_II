## Strings and manipulations

```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "e")

str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "Jeff Goldsmith")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "i think") #all positive, but doesn't look at position
str_detect(string_vec, "^i think") # `^` means start of line
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$") #means something after, only pulls out last string?
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Time for a Pumpkin Spice Latte!",
  "went to the #pumpkinpatch last weekend",
  "Pumpkin Pie is obviously the best pie",
  "SMASHING PUMPKINS -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "Pumpkin")
str_detect(string_vec, "[Pp]umpkin") #everything within bracket, can match either or
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "[0-9]") #range of numbers, but will match anything
str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9]") #range of numbers, but only at beginning of line
str_detect(string_vec, "[0-9][a-z]") #range of numbers, and then followed by any lower-case letter
```

## looking at 7s

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7.11") # `.` means ANYTHING
```

## Special characters, `\` before it

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
str_detect(string_vec, "\\[[0-9]")
```
